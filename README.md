## 1. About this Project 

This is a project that I create in the Algorithms and Data Structure class. The motivation of this project is to implement an algorithm that can be used in a search engine, and analyze time complexity. In this project, I create a trie tree with multiple functions such as lookup a word in the tree, print all words in the tree alphabetically, finding the k most common word, and autocomplete a word. 

- Time: Spring 2021
- Duration: 3 weeks 
- Language: Python 
- Techniques: Tree structure
